## Problem Statement

Imagine you're going shopping with a list of items and their prices. You have a specific amount of money you can spend. Your task is to find two items on your list whose prices add up exactly to the amount of money you have. You can only buy each item once, and there's only one combination of items that matches the exact amount of money you have.

## How it Works

1. **Input Prices**: Enter the number of items and their prices.
2. **Input Target**: Specify the target amount you want to spend.
3. **Find Items**: The program finds two items whose prices add up to the target amount.
4. **Output**: Get the indices of the items if found, else get informed that no combination of items matches the target amount.

## Example

Suppose you have the following list of items with their prices:

- Item 1: $10
- Item 2: $5
- Item 3: $15
- Item 4: $7

And you have $12 to spend.

Your task is to find two items from the list whose prices add up to $12. In this case, you would buy Item 1 and Item 4, as their prices ($10 + $7 = $17) match the amount you have to spend.
