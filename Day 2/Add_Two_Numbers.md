## Adding Backwards Numbers

Imagine you have two numbers written on pieces of paper. But instead of being written in the usual way, they are written backward. So, for example, instead of writing 342, you write 2, then 4, and then 3. Let's call these numbers "backwards numbers."

Now, your task is to add these two backwards numbers together as if they were written normally, and then give the result in the same backwards format.

Here's how you would do it:

- You start from the right side of both numbers.
- You add the digits together and write down the result.
- If the result is two digits (like 10), you write down the last digit and remember to carry over the first digit to add to the next pair of digits.
- Then, you move to the next pair of digits in both numbers and repeat the process.
- You keep doing this until you reach the end of both numbers.

### Example

If you have 342 and 465:
- You add 2 and 5, which gives you 7.
- You add 4 and 6, which gives you 10 (but you write down 0 and remember to carry over 1).
- You add 3, 4, and the carried-over 1, which gives you 8.
So, the result is 7, 0, and 8, which represents the number 807.

You basically add the numbers column by column, just like you learned in school, but here you're doing it in reverse order because the numbers are written backward. And when you finish, you have the sum of the two numbers also written backward.
