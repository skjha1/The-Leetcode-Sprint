# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

This problem involves finding the length of the longest substring in a given string without any repeating characters.

## Real-world Analogy: Shopping Trip

Imagine you have a shopping list where each item is represented by a character, and you want to find the longest consecutive sequence of items on the list without repeating any items. Your goal is to determine the maximum number of unique items you can buy in a single shopping trip without purchasing the same item more than once.

Here's how the analogy relates to the problem of finding the longest substring without repeating characters:

- **Shopping list items represent characters**: Each item on the shopping list represents a character in the input string.
- **Consecutive sequence of items represents a substring**: The consecutive sequence of items you select from the shopping list represents a substring of characters in the input string.
- **The length of the sequence represents the length of the substring**: The number of items you select in the shopping trip represents the length of the substring.
- **Ensuring unique items represent no repeating characters**: To ensure that you don't purchase the same item more than once, you must select each item only once during the shopping trip.
- **Maximizing the number of unique items represents finding the longest substring**: Your goal is to maximize the number of unique items you select during the shopping trip (characters in the substring) while ensuring that each item is selected only once.

Now, let's walk through the steps using this analogy:

1. **Start with an empty shopping cart**: Initially, your shopping cart is empty.
2. **Select items one by one from the shopping list**: You start selecting items (adding characters to the substring) from the beginning of the shopping list.
3. **Ensure items are unique**: As you select items, you must check if the item you're about to select is already in your shopping cart. If it is, it means you've already selected that item, so you don't select it again. You keep track of the items you've selected so far.
4. **Keep track of the longest sequence of items**: As you select items, you keep track of the length of the sequence (substring) at each step. You update the length whenever you find a longer substring without repeating characters.
5. **Continue until the end of the shopping list**: You continue selecting items (adding characters to the substring) until you reach the end of the shopping list (input string).
6. **Return the length of the longest sequence of items**: Once you've processed all the items, you return the length of the longest sequence of unique items you've found.

By following these steps, you can find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters, similar to determining the maximum number of unique items you can buy in a single shopping trip without purchasing any item more than once.
