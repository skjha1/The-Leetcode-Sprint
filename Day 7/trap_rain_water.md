# Trapping Rain Water Problem

## Problem Description

The Trapping Rain Water problem involves calculating the amount of rainwater that can be trapped between bars of varying heights arranged in an array. Each element in the array represents the height of a bar. The objective is to determine the total amount of water that can be trapped.

## Approach

We solve the Trapping Rain Water problem using the two-pointer approach:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.

2. **Iterate through the Array**: Move the pointers towards each other, comparing the heights of the bars at each step.

3. **Calculate Trapped Water**:
   - If the height of the bar at the left pointer is less than or equal to the height of the bar at the right pointer, calculate the trapped water at the left pointer position and move the left pointer to the right.
   - If the height of the bar at the right pointer is less than the height of the bar at the left pointer, calculate the trapped water at the right pointer position and move the right pointer to the left.

4. **Continue Until Pointers Meet**: Repeat the process until the pointers meet.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
